## Functionality

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, you are presented with a series of prompts for password criteria:
    - Password length
    - Lower case
    - Upper case
    - Numeric
    - Special characters

The input is validated to ensure a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters, as well as at least one character type selection. A password is then generated that matches the selected criteria and displayed on the page.
